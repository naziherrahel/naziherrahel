## Research Profile

I am an **AI and Computer Vision researcher** with a strong focus on **applied visual perception systems** and their transition from research prototypes to deployable, reproducible pipelines. My work lies at the intersection of **deep learning, video understanding, and AI system engineering**, with an emphasis on robustness in real-world environments.

In parallel, I am an **instructor at Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU) / BRICS School**, where I teach courses in Computer Vision, AI Implementation Technologies, and Software Development Technologies.

## Research Interests

* Object detection and tracking in video streams
* Temporal modeling and object-level consistency
* Fire and anomaly detection in real-world environments
* Robust computer vision under visual ambiguity (lighting, reflections, motion)
* Deployment-aware AI system design
* Reproducible experiments and evaluation protocols

---

## Teaching

**Bachelor-level Courses**:

* Computer Vision
* AI Implementation Technologies

## Research Philosophy

> *High-performing models are insufficient without robustness, reproducibility, and deployability.*

I approach AI research from a **systems-oriented perspective**, where model design, data handling, evaluation methodology, and deployment constraints are considered jointly rather than in isolation.
